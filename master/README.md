# Initialization

The Terraform configurations in this folder should be run from the master account to set up the sub-accounts and the necessary role assumptions for admin users. The configurations will create an AWS organization linked to the master account and three sub-accounts tied to the organization:

- Infosec
- Prod
- Non-Prod

Note that each account requires a unique email address, not associated with any other AWS account. Update the variables in the root [`shared.tfvars`](../shared.tfvars) with email addresses for your organization.

Within each sub-account, the configurations create an admin role tied to the default administrator policy and set up a trust with the infosec account for role assumption. Policies are created in the Infosec account that allow role assumption for each of those sub-account admin role. A `temp-admin` user is created with those policies attached.

A Terragrunt policy and associated role are created that allows updating the S3 bucket and Dynamo DB table that are used by Terraform for managing state. Terragrunt is configured to assume this role in the root [`terraform.tfvars`](../terraform.tfvars).

## Prerequisites

This configuration will create an access key pair for the `temp-admin` user. The secret key will be PGP encrypted. In order to encrypt and decrypt the key, you must have a [keybase](https://keybase.io) account with a PGP key applied and have the keybase app running during the run.

## Usage

The following steps must be performed manually through the AWS Console before the Terraform can be run:
1. Create the AWS master account and promptly lock it down.
2. Be sure to activate IAM access to billing if you want to delegate billing access to users. [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#tutorial-billing-step1)
3. Request a service limit increase from AWS support to increase the number of accounts that can be connected to your organization. The default limit is one additional account.
4. Create the policy named `TerraformInit` as defined in `TerraformInit-IAM-Policy.txt`.
5. Create an `terraform-init` IAM user (no console access) and apply the `TerraformInit` policy.

Run the Terraform configurations as the `terraform-init` user to setup the initial accounts and users:
1. Make sure keybase is running. It will prompt you for your password the first time the script tries to access your PGP key.
2. Run the `init.sh` script from the `init` folder. Pass the access key and secret key of the `terraform-init` user and the keybase profile as parameters. Optionally, pass the name of an IAM user defined in your `accounts/infosec/users.tf` configuration to have a one-time password generated for the user. You can also specify an AWS region.
```
init.sh -a terraform_-_init_access_key -s terraform_-_init_secret_key -k keybase_profile [-u user_name] [-r aws_region]
```
3. The script will configure Terragrunt to use a local backend for state and apply the configurations from the `organizations` folder to create the sub-accounts. When prompted, confirm that you want to create the resources.
4. It will then configure Terragrunt to use the S3 remote backend and re-init Terraform to copy the state. When propmted, confirm that you want to copy the existing state to the new S3 backend.
5. The script will then run the `temp-admin` configurations to create the `temp-admin` user. When prompted, confirm that you want to create the resources. It will then use the output of the apply to retrieve the secret key and encrypted secret access key for the `temp-admin` user.
6. Next, it will apply all the configurations in the `accounts` folder as the `temp-admin` user. Make sure you have added IAM user resources to `accounts/infosec/users.tf` so you will be able to access the new accounts. When prompted, confirm that you want to apply the configs for all the sub-folders.
7. If you passed the `-u` parameter, it will generate the one-time password for the specified user. When prompted, confirm that you want to create the login. 
8. Finally, it will delete the `temp-admin` user and display the login URLs for your new account. When prompted, confirm that you want to delete the resources.

If you need to re-apply the configurations after the state has been copied to S3, add the `-l` flag to the `init.sh` command. This will skip the step of configuring Terragrunt to use local state, and will only use the remote state.

Once initialization is complete, delete the `terraform-init` IAM user from the master account. Future terragrunt runs should be done by IAM users with appropriate permissions.
